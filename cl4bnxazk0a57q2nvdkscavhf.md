## When to quit your job?

Most full-time employees like the security their job provides. On the other hand, this security could be only an illusion. Changing a job is easier said than done. So what are some of the reasons that might compel you to quit your job?

Change is hard, and most people tend to maintain the status quo. Here are some excellent reasons to start you thinking about a new job.

- ðŸ”¸ Discrimination, harassment, or mobbing
- ðŸ”¸ Toxic environment, lousy boss, or a coworker
- ðŸ”¸ Undervalued at your current job
- ðŸ”¸ Not growing / learning
- ðŸ”¸ Underpaid

## Discrimination, harassment, or mobbing
This is the single, most important reason to quit your job! While I previously identified a Toxic environment, a bad boss, or a coworker as the most significant reason, I think they are, in fact, two similar but different things.

Not only is it illegal, but it can also seriously affect your health, well-being, and confidence.

Sometimes, it might happen there is only one rotten apple. Make sure to notify Human Resources (or equivalent department) and your boss (unless they are the cause).

However, some organizations don't care, and this could be even worse in environments that are not inclusive or lack proper training.

Don't stay at a job where you don't feel safe, are discriminated against, or are a victim of mobbing.

## Toxic environment, bad boss, or a coworker
You wake up and don't feel like going to work - many have experienced this feeling. It could be a toxic environment that promotes terrible values, a boss that does not appreciate you, or an annoying coworker.

Many people tolerate this because they have to meet the ends. They can't afford to 
change a job because of these "insignificant" things.

Give it enough time, and it will start eating you inside out. It's better to recognize this on time and make a plan.

## Feeling undervalued
When was the last time your boss praised your work? Or should I say - when did you get any feedback at all. Right!

You're pulling in your weight at work, doing everything they ask you to, and even more. But no one seems to appreciate this.

No raise, no bonus, not even - thank you!

## Not growing/learning
I've heard so many programmers quit their job because they stopped learning. They couldn't grow in their role anymore and they feared for their future. Rightly so!

The moment you stop learning as a programmer is when you're out of the game. The IT industry is very dynamic and programming, just like many other jobs in the industry, requires dedication and lifelong learning.

Learning on the job is one of the best forms of learning.

## Underpaid
The worse thing than being underpaid is - not knowing that you are underpaid! Believe it or not, this happens, and I've heard some sad stories about senior people getting less than juniors. It certainly doesn't seem right!

Companies often do not allow their employees to discuss salaries openly. This practice is, to my knowledge, illegal in many countries.

Other people know their worth and are actively discussing their salary with the company or looking for a way out. Remember, ask for raise! The majority of companies won't do it on their own.

The right time to ask for a raise is after the probationary period and then at least once a year.

## Recommendations
So, what are your options? It's always a good idea to have your CV updated. You never know when the right opportunity might present itself. However, before changing jobs, try to address issues and problems with your superiors.

Please, don't compromise when it comes to your health and well-being. There is always another job, however hard that change could be.

Start looking for a new job if you notice any of the above-mentioned signs. The sooner you do it, the less you will have to keep up with the bad situation at your current job.

Good luck!
